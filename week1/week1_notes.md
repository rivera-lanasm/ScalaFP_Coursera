### SBT Tutorial and Sumbission of Assignments
- [guide to using SBT](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/blob/master/02-sbt/README.md)
- you can start the Scala interpreter inside sbt using the `console` task
- you can run a main object with `run`
- you can run test suite, with the "test" command

**Testing with JUnit**

**SBT Project Directory**
- **Base or project's root directory:**
    - the “base or project's root directory” is the directory containing the project. 
    - `build.sbt` is declared in the top-level directory that is, the base directory.
- **project directory** 
    - another build inside your build, which knows how to build your build. 
    - To distinguish the builds, we sometimes use the term proper build to refer to your build, and meta-build to refer to the build in project

**Misc Notes**
- [avoid using return in functions](https://tpolecat.github.io/2014/05/09/return.html)
