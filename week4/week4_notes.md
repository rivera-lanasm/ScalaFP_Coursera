**Lecture 4.1: Objects Everywhere**
#### ================================

**Pure Object Orientation**
- in which **every value is an object**
- if lang is based on classes, this means that **the type** of each value **is also a class**
- what about **primitive types?**

**Standard Classes: Pure Booleans**
- the `Boolean` type maps to the JVM's primitive type boolean 
- but you could define it as a class just as well without any changes in user code!
  - thus, scala can be considered Pure OO based on the language's capabilities 
```
from test4.scala --> link to git and hardcode
```

**Standard Classes: Pure Natural Numbers**

- do not use standard numerical classes
- implement a sub-object and a sub-class
- Peano Numbers

```
From test4_1

#### ================================
**Lecture 4.2: Functions and Objects**
#### ================================
- After encoding **primitive types** as classes, the other two fundamental types of values that are left are **instances of classes** and **functions**
- How do function types relate to classes?
- How do function values relate to objects?
